# GSoC NIU Projects 2025: `datashuttle`

Below you can find our list of projects for GSoC 2025 (aka our "Ideas List"). 

A project can be one of three sizes: small (90 h), medium (175 h) or large  large (350 h). The standard coding period is 12 weeks for medium and large projects, and 8 weeks for small projects. 

However, GSoC contributors can request in their proposal up to a 22-week coding period, if they know they may have other commitments or certain weeks when they will not be able to work full time on their GSoC project. During the project preparation period (called "community bonding period"), both the GSoC contributor and the mentors will agree on a schedule and sign off on it.

If you are interested in any of these projects, feel free to reach out by opening a new topic on [Zulip](https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/), and tagging the potential mentors.
