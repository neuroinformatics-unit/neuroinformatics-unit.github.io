# Google Summer of Code

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC) is a global fully online program whose aim is to bring new developers into open source software. It is a great opportunity to gain experience in real-world software development while helping the open source community. Additionally, GSoC contributors receive a stipend from Google. 

Initially focused on university students, since 2022 the program has expanded to welcome students and all beginner contributors to open source who are 18 years and older to participate.

In 2025, NIU is applying for the first time to be a mentoring organization with GSoC, pairing candidates with NIU developers to work on ~12-week programming projects. So if you are interested in contributing to open source software, this is a great opportunity to get involved!

Successful applicants will spend their summer contributing code to our open source organization under the guidance of our mentoring team. Below you can find some more information on the projects that we are putting forward for mentoring in GSoC, and some guidelines to help you with your application.

To read more about the program, visit the [GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), check out the [GSoC FAQs](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq) and have a look at the [2025 Timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline).

## Projects
A project can run for a duration of 10-22 weeks. The standard length is 12 weeks, but projects can be planned for a longer duration at the start, and they can be extended (by the org admin) on request during the program.


A project can be one of two sizes, either large (350 h) or medium (175 h). 

Contributions are open to students AND to beginners in open source software development

Please see the full list of projects [here](projects_2025.md).


## Apply to GSoC with NIU
As part of your application to GSoC, you will need to submit a project proposal. To help you with this, we provide some [guidelines](guidelines) with tips on how to write a successful NIU proposal. 

You may also want to checkout other useful guides, such as the [GSoC Contributor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/), the [Python Software Foundation guide](https://python-gsoc.org/), the [OpenAstronomy](https://openastronomy.org/gsoc/student_guidelines.html) one, or the [INCF](https://www.incf.org/recommendations-gsoc-contributors) one, all of which we are closely following.

If you are interested in any of the NIU projects on offer, feel free to get in touch with us via [Zulip](https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/) with any questions. We encourage interested GSoC applicants to make their initial contact with project mentors early on, to clarify and strengthen their application.

For clarity, please always use your full name: when getting a [Zulip](https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/) account, when registering for the program, and when submitting your project plan.
