# Google Summer of Code

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC) is a global fully online program whose aim is to bring new developers into open source software. It is a great opportunity to gain experience in real-world software development while helping the open source community. Additionally, GSoC contributors receive a stipend from Google. 

Initially focused on university students, since 2022 the program has expanded to welcome students and all beginner contributors to open source who are 18 years and older to participate.

In 2025, NIU is applying for the first time to be a mentoring organization with GSoC, pairing candidates with NIU developers to work on ~12-week programming projects. So if you are interested in contributing to open source software, this is a great opportunity to get involved!


## How does GSoC work?
Through the GSoC application process, interested applicants submit project proposals to the various organizations participating in GSoC - in our case, the NIU. Then, the organizations select which proposals they would like to see funded by Google. Successful applicants will spend their summer contributing code to our open source organization under the guidance of our mentoring team. 

Below you can find some more information on the [projects](projects_2025) that we are putting forward for GSoC 2025, and some [guidelines](#apply-to-gsoc-with-niu) to help you with your application.

To learn more about the program, we recommend reading the [GSoC FAQs](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq) and the [GSoC Contributor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/), and having a look at the [2025 Timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline). For general information, see also the [GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).


## Apply to GSoC with NIU

As part of your application to GSoC, you will need to submit a project proposal. To help you with this, we provide some [guidelines](guidelines) on how to write a successful NIU proposal. 

You may also want to checkout other useful application guides, such as:
- the [GSoC Contributor Guide: writing a proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal), 
- the [Python Software Foundation guide](https://python-gsoc.org/), 
- the [OpenAstronomy](https://openastronomy.org/gsoc/student_guidelines.html) one, or 
- the [INCF](https://www.incf.org/recommendations-gsoc-contributors) one,

all of which we are closely following. Applicants are given about 2 weeks to complete their applications. For further details see the [GSoC Contributor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal).

If you are interested in any of the NIU projects on offer, feel free to get in touch with us via [Zulip](https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/) with any questions. Potential GSoC contributors are encouraged to get in touch with participating organizations as soon as the list of accepted organizations is published (this year, on the [27th February 2025](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline#february_27_-_1800_utc)). 

For clarity, please always use your full name when getting a [Zulip](https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/) account, when registering for the program, and when submitting your project plan. 

## Team

The NIU GSoC team for 2025 is composed of the following members. To read more about the different roles involved in GSoC, see [GSoC Participant Roles](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/#participant-roles).

Our working languages are Python and English ;) - but we also speak other languages! 

Additional languages are specified with a üó£Ô∏è icon.
