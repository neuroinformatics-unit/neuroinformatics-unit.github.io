# Google Summer of Code 2026

## GSoC NIU Projects 2026

NIU is offering a variety of projects for GSoC 2026, organized under four of our software tools. Click on a card below to learn more about the project ideas for each tool.

A project can be one of three sizes: small (90 h), medium (175 h) or large (350 h). The standard coding period is 12 weeks for medium and large projects, and 8 weeks for small projects.

However, GSoC contributors can request in their proposal up to a 22-week coding period, if they know they may have other commitments or certain weeks when they will not be able to work full time on their GSoC project. During the project preparation period (called "community bonding period"), both the GSoC contributor and the mentors will agree on a schedule and sign off on it.

Our GSoC ideas are based within specific, larger open source packages we develop. Some of these have specific project ideas associated with them. 
Others do not yet have specific project ideas, but all on this list welcome ideas developed by GSoC participants. Please reach out to us via our [GSoc Zulip channel](https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/487898-Google-Summer-of-Code) to discuss.


### BrainGlobe
[BrainGlobe](https://brainglobe.info/) is a community-driven suite of open-source Python tools. The BrainGlobe tools are widely used to process, analyse and visualise images of brains (and other related data) in neuroscientific research.

Our working language is English, but our mentors for these projects also speak Italian, French, and German.

### Movement
Markerless pose estimation tools based on deep learning, such as [DeepLabCut](https://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut) and [SLEAP](https://sleap.ai/), have revolutionised the study of animal behaviour. However, there is currently no user-friendly, general-purpose approach for processing and analysing the trajectories generated by these popular tools. To fill this gap, we're developing [`movement`](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/latest/), an open-source Python package that provides a unified data analysis interface across pose estimation frameworks.

## Team

The NIU GSoC team for 2026 is composed of the following members. To read more about the different roles involved in GSoC, see [GSoC Participant Roles](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/#participant-roles).

Our working languages are Python and English ;) - but we also speak other languages! We listed any additional languages spoken by the mentors in each of the projects' descriptions.
