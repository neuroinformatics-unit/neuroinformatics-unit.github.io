# Google Summer of Code 2026

## GSoC NIU Projects 2026

NIU is offering a variety of projects for GSoC 2026, organized under four of our software tools. Click on a card below to learn more about the project ideas for each tool.

A project can be one of three sizes: small (90 h), medium (175 h) or large (350 h). The standard coding period is 12 weeks for medium and large projects, and 8 weeks for small projects.

However, GSoC contributors can request in their proposal up to a 22-week coding period, if they know they may have other commitments or certain weeks when they will not be able to work full time on their GSoC project. During the project preparation period (called "community bonding period"), both the GSoC contributor and the mentors will agree on a schedule and sign off on it.

Our GSoC ideas are based within specific, larger open source packages we develop. Some of these have specific project ideas associated with them. 
Others do not yet have specific project ideas, but all on this list welcome ideas developed by GSoC participants. Please reach out to us via our [GSoc Zulip channel](https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/487898-Google-Summer-of-Code) to discuss.


## BrainGlobe 
[BrainGlobe](https://brainglobe.info/) is a community-driven suite of open-source Python tools. The BrainGlobe tools are widely used to process, analyse and visualise images of brains (and other related data) in neuroscientific research.

Our working language is English, but our mentors for these projects also speak Italian, French, and German.

Three BrainGlobe repositories ([morphapi](https://github.com/brainglobe/morphapi), [brainrender](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainrender), [brainreg](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainreg)) are in pure maintenance mode, and therefore excluded from any GSoC project proposals. All other BrainGlobe repositories welcome alternative project ideas!

:::{dropdown} {fas}`brain;sd-text-primary` Refactor `brainglobe-heatmap` to use atlas annotations rather than mesh slices for visualisation
`brainglobe-heatmap` is BrainGlobe's tool to generate heatmap plots of atlases in 2 and 3D. It relies heavily on BrainGlobe's meshes, which can cause small imprecisions in visualising data. In 2D it also can fail to slice the meshes along a plane correctly. This could be improved by moving the heatmap functions to relies on the atlas annotations instead of the meshes. There are a number of additional refactoring improvements that could be done to `brainglobe-heatmap`.

**Deliverables**
* Refactor 2D plotting functionality to use atlas annotations instead of meshes
* Tests for new functionality
* Ensure any refactored functionality has docstrings
* A blog on the [BrainGlobe website](https://brainglobe.info/blog/) about the work done
* (Stretch goal) - further improvements to `brainglobe-heatmaps`

**Duration**

:::{dropdown} {fas}`brain;sd-text-primary` Improving the user experience in `brainrender-napari`
`brainrender-napari` allows BrainGlobe users to download and visualise a variety of neuroanatomical atlases through a graphical user interface. As BrainGlobe supports more and more atlases, we'd like to make it more convenient for users to find the atlas they are interested in, and visualise it in more custom ways.

**Deliverables**
* Add sorting functionality to `brainrender-napari` tables
* Allow users to filter atlas tables by species
* Add functionality to visualise the atlas annotation with preset colours
* Any added functionality will require extensive tests and documentation
* A blog on the [BrainGlobe website](https://brainglobe.info/blog/) about the work done

:::

:::{dropdown} {fas}`brain;sd-text-primary` Expand `cellfinder` to accept different types of input data (several or single channels, 2.5 dimensions)
BrainGlobe's `cellfinder` tool allows researchers to detect flourescent cells in whole-brain microscopy images. It requires whole-brain images of both a signal and a background channels as input, which not many researchers have. We'd like to expand the types of inputs `cellfinder` support to include brain slices (essentially 2D data) and single channel inputs (no background channel).


**Deliverables**

## Movement
Markerless pose estimation tools based on deep learning, such as [DeepLabCut](https://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut) and [SLEAP](https://sleap.ai/), have revolutionised the study of animal behaviour. However, there is currently no user-friendly, general-purpose approach for processing and analysing the trajectories generated by these popular tools. To fill this gap, we're developing [`movement`](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/latest/), an open-source Python package that provides a unified data analysis interface across pose estimation frameworks.


Our working language is English, but our mentors for these projects also speak Spanish and Mandarin.

:::{dropdown} {fas}`video;sd-text-primary` Adding support for tracked segmentation masks
`movement` has initially focused on pose estimation data, but the [long term goal](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/latest/community/mission-scope.html) of the package is to support all animal tracking data formats that are relevant to animal behaviour research. With tools like [SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2) or [OCTRON](https://octron-tracking.github.io/OCTRON-docs/) that track segmentation masks in videos, adding support for such data would be a valuable extension of `movement`'s input capabilities. In this project, we would like to explore how segmentation‑based tracking data can be integrated into the `movement` framework and design a user-friendly workflow for doing so.


**Deliverables**
* Support for at least one of the file formats output by a popular segmentation and tracking software package.

:::{dropdown} {fas}`video;sd-text-primary` Adding a module for trajectory complexity metrics
Quantitative characterisation of the trajectories of moving animals is an important component of many behavioural and ecological studies, and also falls within scope for `movement`. We would like to enable our users to perform statistical characterisation of trajectories through a variety of well-defined metrics such as straightness index, tortuosity, and sinuosity. Functions for computing these metrics could be implemented in a standalone module under [`movement.kinematics`](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/movement/tree/main/movement/kinematics). 

**Deliverables**

:::{dropdown} {fas}`video;sd-text-primary` Adding a module for metrics of collective behaviour
Understanding how individuals coordinate their movements within a group is a central question in behavioural ecology, ethology, and neuroscience. Since `movement` already supports multi-individual tracking data, it is well positioned to enable users to quantify collective behaviour through established metrics such as group polarisation (alignment of heading directions), and nearest-neighbour distances. We would like to implement functions for computing collective behaviour metrics in a dedicated module.

**Deliverables**
* A detailed GitHub issue describing suitable metrics to add.

## Ethology
The main goal of [`ethology`](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/ethology) is to facilitate the application of a wide range of computer vision tasks to animal behaviour research, by providing a unified data analysis interface across these tasks. 

Our working language is English, but our mentors for these projects also speak Spanish.

:::{dropdown} {fas}`video;sd-text-primary` Expanding annotations support in `ethology`

`ethology` is a package in early development, whose goal is to make it very easy to mix and match computer vision tools to analyse animal behaviour data. Currently, `ethology` supports loading and curating bounding box annotation datasets.We would like to expand the set of supported annotation types to include mask annotations, and add a UI interface for defining different annotation types in `napari`.


**Deliverables**
<!-- Goals, or expected status after Community Bonding Period, Start of Coding, End of Coding. Stretch goals? -->
- Support for mask annotation datasets in `ethology` (following the current bounding box annotations dataset).

- Support for defining mask annotations in `napari`: drawing, exporting to file (e.g. JSON COCO format and as `ethology` dataset netCDF) and loading from file.
- Example use-cases in the `ethology` [gallery](https://ethology.neuroinformatics.dev/latest/examples/index.html).
- (Optional) Support for defining keypoint annotations in `napari`
