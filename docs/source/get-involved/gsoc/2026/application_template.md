# Application template

::: {admonition} AI policy
:class: warning
Before submitting an application, please see our [AI policy](../../ai_policy). AI tools are great to help with spelling 
and grammar, but in these applications we want to hear what you think. We will not accept any applications in which any 
substantial chunk (i.e. whole sentences) are created with AI.
:::


Please use the following template to submit your application to the NIU GSoC 2026 program, and to discuss your proposal with the community.

The more closely you follow this template, the easier it will be for us to review your application! Please include clear headings for all the different sections.

**If all sections are not fully completed, the application will not be considered!**

N.B. If you would like this template in Markdown format, click "Show Source" on the right hand side.


## Project title
Follow the following format for the proposal title: `<Package Name>-<Project Name> (<Your-Name>)` when applying.

E.g. "movement: support for Kalman filters (Jane Doe)".

## Personal details
Please include the following information:
- **Full name** (include preferred name if desired)
- **Email**
- **GitHub username**
- **Zulip username**
- **Location & time-zone**
- **Personal website / project portfolio** (optional)
- **Code contribution**

  Please link a pull request, ideally submitted to your chosen project or one of the NIU tools. Applications without a code contribution won't be considered. It must be publicly visible and represent your own work, although you may have help from other developers in the community to further improve it. It must be meaningful code contribution (i.e. not just fixing a minor spelling mistake). While AI tools (such as Copilot etc) can be a very useful, contributions mostly created by AI are unlikely to be useful, and will not be accepted. You can link more than one pull request if desired.

## Project proposal
_Length: max 1 page_

- **Synopsis**

  Briefly explain: what is the project about? Why is it important? What are the goals? What are the deliverables? How would the open source community benefit from this project?

- **Implementation timeline**

  Please include the following information:
    1. A bullet point list with **minimal set of deliverables**
    2. Additional **stretch goals** or "if time allows" deliverables (optional)
    3. A detailed **weekly timeline**: when do you plan to do what?
        - Please use a week as a minimal unit of time, and include any planned vacations or other commitments.
        - This timeline could be formatted as a table.
        - Remember to also include the number of hours per week you plan to work on the GSoC project.
        - When estimating the required time for a task, keep in mind deliverables should include investigation/research, coding and documentation.
        - The default schedule for GSoC is 12 weeks - see the [GSoC timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) for precise dates.
        - Also please specify any prep work you plan to do during the "Community bonding period".
        - Usually week 1's deliverables already include some code. Week 6 marks the mid-term point, where usually more than half of the project should be completed. At the end of week 11 you may want to try to "freeze" the code and complete any remaining tests or documentation in weeks 11 and 12.

- **Communication plan**

  Please explain: how do you plan to communicate with your mentor? How often? (e.g., daily or weekly stand-ups, longer meetings..?) What communication channels will you use? (e.g., video calls, Zulip chat...?)

## Personal statement

_Length: max 0.75 page_

- **Past experience.**

  Please describe your past experience with programming, open source, research or any other experience you deem relevant for the project you are applying for. Any successful open source projects, published work or content of the like should definitely be highlighted.
- **Motivation: why this project?**

  Why are you interested in this specific project? What aspects of it motivate you to work on it? How does it link to your personal or professional interests? How do you envision its impact in the open source community?
- **Match: why you?**

  Why should we choose you for this project? What unique skills or experiences can you bring to the project and the community? Is there something you have worked on in the past that makes you particularly well-suited for this project?
- **Availability**

  Please state if you have any other plans for the work period (school work, another job, planned vacation)? If so, how do you plan to combine them with your GSoC work?

## GSoC

_Length: max 0.25 page_

- **GSoC experience**

  What do you expect from the program?

- **Are you also applying to projects with other organisations in GSoC 2025?**

  If so, which ones? What would be your preference in case of a tie?

## Future contributions
_Length: max 1 page_

- **After GSoC**

  How do you envision your contributions to the organisation continuing after GSoC? Please be realistic, including your other commitments. We do not expect everyone to start working full-time on open-source, but we want GSoC to help build our community long-term.

- **Further ideas**

  Other than your chosen project, what else could best improve your chosen repository, or the overall organisation? Please describe what you would do (if given the time and resources) to improve our tools. This should not be related to any existing issue/PR etc. We want to hear what you think, and to show you have understood the organisation.
