:::{grid-item-card} {fas}`video;sd-text-primary` Support for Kalman filters in `movement`
<!-- :link: projects-2025
:link-type: ref -->

[`movement`](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/) is a Python toolbox for analysing animal body movements across space and time.

The goal of this project would be to add support for Kalman filters to the `movement` package, which is used to analyse behavioural data.

:::{grid-item-card} {fas}`video;sd-text-primary` Web-based graphical interface for `movement`

[`movement`](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/) is a Python toolbox for analysing animal body movements across space and time.

The goal of this project would be to develop a proof-of-concept prototype for a web-based graphical interface. This one is quite separate from the rest of the codebase, so may be a good standalone project for an intern
