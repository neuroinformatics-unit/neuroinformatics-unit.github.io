# GSoC NIU Projects 2025

Below you can find our list of projects for GSoC 2025 (aka our "Ideas List"). 

<!-- There are three main milestones in a GSoC project: the community bonding period, the start of coding, and the coding end.

During the community bonding period, the GSoC contributor gets to know the community and participates in project discussions. They also prepare for their project, setting up their development environments, learning how their projectâ€™s source control works, refining their project plans, and reading any necessary documentation. 

The start of coding is the official start of the program and when the GSoC contributor starts executing on their project. The coding end is when the project is due. GSoC contributors are encouraged to continue work on their projects after the coding end, but only work done before this date can be evaluated. GSoC contributors will need to submit mentor evaluations and a link to their code. -->

A project can be one of three sizes: small (90 h), medium (175 h) or large  large (350 h). The standard coding period is 12 weeks for medium and large projects, and 8 weeks for small projects. 

However, GSoC contributors can request in their proposal up to a 22-week coding period, if they know they may have other commitments or certain weeks when they will not be able to work full time on their GSoC project. During the project preparation period (called "community bonding period"), both the GSoC contributor and the mentors will agree on a schedule and sign off on it.

:::{grid-item-card} {fas}`video;sd-text-primary` Support for Kalman filters in `movement`

[`movement`](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/) is a Python toolbox for analysing animal body movements across space and time.

The goal of this project would be to add support for Kalman filters to the `movement` package, which is used to analyse behavioural data.

**Duration**
~90 hour, ~175 hours or ~350 hours 

**Difficulty**

<!-- is this project geared more toward a student level or a more advanced developer level? -->

**Required skills**
Python

**Nice-to-haves**

:::{grid-item-card} {fas}`video;sd-text-primary` Web-based graphical interface for `movement`

[`movement`](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/) is a Python toolbox for analysing animal body movements across space and time.

The goal of this project would be to develop a proof-of-concept prototype for a web-based graphical interface. This one is quite separate from the rest of the codebase, so may be a good standalone project for an intern
