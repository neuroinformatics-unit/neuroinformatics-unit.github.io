# NIU policy on contributions using AI

Generative AI tools have developed quickly in the last few years, and have changed how many people write code. General 
purpose tools such as [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) or specific code development tools such as 
[Cursor](https://cursor.com/) now mean software development is quicker and more accessible than ever before. We only 
expect these developments to continue, and AI agents to play a crucial role in the way that we create software. 

Many members of the NIU use AI in their workflows, as do many of our collaborators. We are also fortunate to have a 
large community of contributors to our tools. However, many potential contributions are low-quality and either require 
lots of work to get them into shape, or simply need to be rejected immediately as they do not solve the problem at hand. 
In many cases, these contributions appear to be mostly, or entirely, AI generated.
