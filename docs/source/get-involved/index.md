# Get involved

## Contributing to Neuroinformatics Unit projects
We always welcome contributions to all of our software, whether from experienced developers, or researchers looking 
to make their first open-source contribution. 

Many of our projects are quite large and the software is used by researchers around the world. For this reason, all 
contributions go through a review process to make sure that they are necessary, useful, correct and complete. This 
"code review" process can often be daunting to first time contributors. It is often not difficult to meet these criteria,
but it can be _complicated_. 

For this reason we have written some documents to outline the processes we use, so hopefully they aren't so opaque. 
These include our [general development guidelines](development_guidelines) and 
[guidelines for specific languages and frameworks](languages_frameworks).

We are also happy to guide new contributors through the process. For more details please see 
[our documentation about mentored open source contributions](mentoring). Please also see our 
[policy on AI contributions](ai_policy).

## Internships
We offer a number of paid internships each year, through established programs such as 
[Google Summer of Code](gsoc/index) and [In2research](https://in2scienceuk.org/our-programmes/in2research/). 
Unfortunately we do not offer any other formal internship opportunities. 

## Research software engineer and scientist positions
We usually do not have any full time positions available. As and when these are available, they will be advertised here 
and via social media and Zulip.

If you would like to discuss applying for funding to work with us (e.g. a personal fellowship), 
please <a href="mailto:adam.tyson@ucl.ac.uk ?subject=Fellowship">email Adam Tyson</a>.
