# Developer Tools

Below is a selection of the development tools we use and maintain in the Neuroinformatics unit.

## Python Cookiecutter

The SWC Cookiecutter allows quick and easy setup of new python projects. 
The cookiecutter template project contains pre-set configurations for code quality checks, formatting, 
automated testing (pytest, both locally and through GitHub Actions), versioning and release on PyPi.

See the Cookiecutter GitHub page to get started, and our course “Turning your Python scripts into reusable, general-purpose software” materials for more details.
