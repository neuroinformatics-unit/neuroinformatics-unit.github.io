# Data Management

We build datamanagement tools


## SWC Bids

### What is SWC-BIDS?
SWC-BIDS is a neuroscience-project folder structure specification for use in the SWC, based on the BIDS specification widely used in human neuroimaging.

The BIDS specification is a set of rules and guidelines for project folder organisation that ensures consistent data management within and between labs. 
This standardisation makes data-sharing and collaboration much simpler, and allows sharing of analysis tools that can operate on predictable folder structures.

## DataShuttle

Datashuttle is a neuroscience-project manager tool that simplifies building project folders and transferring data.

Datashuttle includes tools for automated generation and transfer of project folders formatted to the SWC-BIDS specification. 

It also contains features to assist in data transfer, including:
* Manage files across multiple data-collection computers by synchronising 
all data to with a centrally stored project. 
* Simply data transfers for processing and analysis by selecting only a sub-set of data to move (e.g. specific subjects, sessions or data types (e.g. behaviour))
