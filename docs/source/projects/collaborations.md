# Collaborations

## UNLE

We have collaborated with Gatsby researcher Pierre Glasser in the productionasation of the UNLE package. UNLE (unnormalised neural likelihood estimation) provide two new methods for simulation-based inference (SBI), a form of Bayesian inference on the outputs of high-fiedelity simulators of natural phenomenon.
