# Electrophysiology

[Spikewrap](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/spikewrap) is a tool to simplify the execution and visualisation of extracellular electrophysiology pre-processing and spike-sorting pipelines. Taking input organised to our [NeuroBlueprint](https://neuroblueprint.neuroinformatics.dev) standard, it will provide a flexible way to process an entire project's electrophysiological data with an easy-to-use interface.

Under the hood Spikewrap utilises the power of SpikeInterface, an open-source tool with many contributors in the electrophysiology analysis feild. Spikewrap aims to abstract away the implementation details to allow researchers to test different pipeline configurations at the click of a button. 

We actively contribute to the developerment of SpikeInterface, ensuring that our efforts benefit existing community projects.
