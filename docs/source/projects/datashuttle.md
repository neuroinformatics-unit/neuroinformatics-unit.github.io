# Datashuttle


Cannot figure out how to embed the icon in the badge

{bdg-primary-line}`primary-line`{fab}`github`

{bdg-primary-line}{fab}`github``primary-line`

{bdg-link-primary-line}`explicit title <https://example.com>`

{bdg-link-primary-line}``` explicit title {fab}`github` <https://example.com>```

Works okay in the button

```{button-link} https://example.com>
:color: primary
:shadow:

Button Text   {fab}`github`
```

Datashuttle is a neuroscience-project manager tool that makes folder management and data transfer simple. 

Datashuttle includes tools for automated generation of new project folders formatted to the SWC-BIDS specification. 
It also contains features to assist in data transfer, including:
* Manage files across multiple data-collection computers by synchronising 
all data to with a centrally stored project. 
* Simply data transfers for processing and analysis by selecting only a sub-set of data to move (e.g. specific subjects, sessions or data types (e.g. behaviour))
