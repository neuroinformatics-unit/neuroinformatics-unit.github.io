# Datashuttle

Datashuttle is a neuroscience-project manager tool that makes folder management and data transfer simple. 

Datashuttle includes tools for automated generation of new project folders formatted to the SWC-BIDS specification. 
It also contains features to assist in data transfer, including:
* Manage files across multiple data-collection computers by synchronising all data to with a centrally stored project. 
* Simplify data transfers for processing and analysis by selecting only a sub-set of data to move.
