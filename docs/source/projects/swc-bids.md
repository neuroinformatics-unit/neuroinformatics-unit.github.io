# SWC-BIDS

## What is SWC-BIDS?
SWC-BIDS is a neuroscience-project folder structure specification for use in the SWC, based on the BIDS specification widely used in human neuroimaging.

The BIDS specification is a set of rules and guidelines for project folder organisation that ensures consistent data management within and between labs. 
This standardisation makes data-sharing and collaboration much simpler, and allows sharing of analysis tools that can operate on predictable folder structures.

Analysis tools developed at the Neuroinformatics Unit will prioritise interoperability with projects organised according to the SWC-BIDS specification.
