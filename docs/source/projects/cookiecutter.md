# SWC Python Cookiecutter

The Python packaging ecosystem is complex and difficult to set up from scratch. This makes it hard to organise new projects in 
order to take advantage of the many python tools for formatting, testing, packing and releasing your code.

The SWC Cookiecutter is a tool used-and-maintained by the Neuroinformatics Unit allowing quick and easy setup of new python projects.
The cookiecutter template project contains pre-set configurations for code checking (e.g. flake8, mypy, isort), formatting (black), automated testing (pytest, both locally and through 
GitHub Actions), versioning (setuptools_scm) and release on PyPi.

See the [Cookiecutter GitHub page](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/python-cookiecutter) to get started, and our course ["Turning your Python scripts into reusable, general-purpose software"](https://sainsburywellcomecentre.github.io/software-skills/events/release_dec_2022.html) materials for more details.
