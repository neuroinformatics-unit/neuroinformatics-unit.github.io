# May 2024
This roadmap is split into "themes" which roughly mirror our current priorities.

## Computational anatomy

## Behavioural analysis

## Extracellular electrophysiology analysis

## Multimodal integration

## Teaching
### Current status
Over the past 18 months, we have delivered a series of computational skills courses at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre
(details can be found on the [Software Skills website](https://software-skills.neuroinformatics.dev/)).

### Q4 2025

Over the next 18 months we will develop our existing courses into a coherent set of materials that can be used to 
deliver an introductory one-week course on the computational skills needed in systems neuroscience, including:
- Basic linux command line usage
- Version control
- Python programming
- Software development best practices
- Good data management
- High performance computing
- Video behavioural analysis
- Multiphoton image analysis
- Extracellular electrophysiology analysis
- Histology analysis
