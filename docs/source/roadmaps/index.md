# Roadmaps

The Neuroinformatics Unit roadmaps give tool users, contributors and collaborators an idea of where our work is heading 
over the next few months and years. We create these roadmaps to communicate our aims, allow others to plan their work, 
and to solicit early feedback.

The aim of these roadmaps is to provide a high-level overview. Detailed roadmaps for specific tools can be found 
on the relevant software repository or website. These roadmaps are not exhaustive, but we hope they are useful. 

If you have any questions or suggestions, please get in touch, either via [Zulip](https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/) 
or <a href="mailto:adam.tyson@ucl.ac.uk ?subject=NIU roadmap">emailing Adam Tyson</a> directly. These 
roadmaps are living documents and will likely be revisited regularly.
