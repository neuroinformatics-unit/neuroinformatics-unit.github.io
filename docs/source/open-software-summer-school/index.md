# Open Software Summer School

**The NIU Open Software Summer School brings together researchers, developers, and users of open-source neuroscience software for some hands-on training, community-building and hacking.**

The [the 2025 event](2025/index) (known as Open Software Week) brought together 44 attendees from 12 countries to learn about open source approaches for handling large images, processing microscopy data and analysing video behavioural data. 
The event will return, **bigger and better**, in summer 2026 at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CzWFFjXJZwX87aMj6) 
in London, U.K. Details are being finalised, but take a look at the details of [the 2025 event](2025/index) for an idea of what you can expect.

Dates of the 2026 event are TBC, but we expect applications to open in early 2026.
