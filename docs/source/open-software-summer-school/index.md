# Open Software Summer School


We are excited to announce the second **NIU Open Software Summer School**, taking
place in **August 2026** at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CzWFFjXJZwX87aMj6) 
in **London, UK**. This event will bring together researchers, developers, and users of open-source software for some hands-on training, community-building and hacking.

[The 2025 event](2025/index) (known as Open Software Week) brought together 44 attendees from 12 countries to learn 
about open source approaches for handling large images, processing microscopy data and analysing video behavioural data. 
In 2026, we will return, with an expanded two-week program adding a new Extracellular Electrophysiology track, 
additional satellite events, guest lectures and opportunities for researchers to present their own work. 

## Schedule

There are four tracks targeted to different audiences.
We encourage you to read each track's description and choose the one(s) that best fits your interests.

:::{admonition} Registration
:class: info
You may register for week 1, week 2 or both weeks. However, you can only register for one track per week, i.e.
Animals in Motion or Large Array Data and BrainGlobe or Extracellular Electrophysiology.

## Key Dates

- **December 1st 2025**: Applications open
- **January 31st 2026**: Applications close
- **March 2026**: Applicants are notified of acceptance
- **July 2026**: Optional preparatory month begins
- **August 17-21 2026**: Week 1 (Animals in Motion & Large Array Data)
- **August 24-28 2026**: Week 2 (BrainGlobe & Extracellular Electrophysiology)

## Preparatory month
All four tracks require a basic knowledge of scientific Python programming. If you don't have this background, that's 
totally fine, we will be running an asynchronous preparatory course in the month before the summer school. Training 
materials and exercises will be shared with participants, and OSSS instructors will be available to answer any questions.

**This preparatory course is mandatory for those without Python experience, and requires a minimum of four hours per week 
commitment for four weeks prior to the summer school**



## Fees
- **Academics**: £300 per week
- **Industry**: £600 per week

### Financial Assistance
A number of fee waivers will be available to applicants who would not otherwise be able to attend the summer school. 
A limited number of travel stipends will also be available, but we encourage applicants to apply for 
[independent travel funding](funding).

### Selected quotes from previous attendees
> Sparked a bit of a eureka moment after months of agonising over how to analyse my data!

> Thank you again for organizing this amazing event

> My whole PhD feels doable now!

> The heterogeneity of the attendees was truly enriching.

> Atmosphere was very friendly and down to earth.
