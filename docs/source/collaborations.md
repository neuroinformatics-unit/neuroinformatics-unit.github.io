# Collaborations

In addition to the [software projects](/projects) lead by the Neuroinformatics Unit, we have many 
collaborations with research labs and other research software engineering teams. 

## Sainsbury Wellcome Centre & Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit
We have many internal collaborations to build or productionise software including:
- Data analysis tools for long term physiology and behavioural recordings ([Project Aeon](https://sainsburywellcomecentre.github.io/aeon_docs/))
- Behavioural analysis pipelines (e.g. [WAZP](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/WAZP), 
[crabs-exploration](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/crabs-exploration)) with the 
[Branco](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/branco-lab) 
and [Margrie](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/margrie-lab) labs (also a collaboration with the 
[UCL Advanced Research Computing Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/advanced-research-computing-centre))
- Assisting in the productionisation of [Neural Playground](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/NeuralPlayground), 
a software framework enabling comparison between hippocampus and entorhinal cortex models
- Data processing pipelines with the 
[SWC Advanced Microscopy Facility](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/content/advanced-microscopy), e.g. 
[brainglobe-stitch](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainglobe-stitch)
- Data preprocessing and analysis tools with the 
[Margrie](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/margrie-lab) lab (e.g. 
[rsp-vision](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/rsp-vision), 
[derotation](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/derotation) and [rc2_analysis](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/rc2_analysis))
- BrainGlobe atlas building and validation with the [Akrami lab](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/akrami-lab)
- Extracellular electrophysiology analysis pipelines ([SpikeWrap](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/spikewrap)) with 
[Stephen Lenzi](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/people/stephen-lenzi)


## UCL
We have an ongoing collaboration with many members of the 
[UCL Advanced Research Computing Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/advanced-research-computing-centre)
to develop computational neuroanatomy ([BrainGlobe](https://brainglobe.info/)) and behavioural analysis tools
(e.g. [WAZP](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/WAZP),
[crabs-exploration](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/crabs-exploration))

## External
- We have an ongoing collaboration with the [Keshavarzi Laboratory](https://www.keshavarzilab.com/) at the University 
of Cambridge to build multiple tools, including [movement](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/) and 
[DataShuttle](https://datashuttle.neuroinformatics.dev/)
- We contribute to multiple open source projects, including [SpikeInterface](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- We collaborate with the [Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics](https://alleninstitute.org/division/neural-dynamics/)
on [movement](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/).
