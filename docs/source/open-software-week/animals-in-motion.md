# Track: Animals in Motion 

The study of animal behaviour has been transformed by the increasing use of
machine learning-based tools, such as DeepLabCut and SLEAP, which can track the
positions of animals and their body parts from video footage.

## Pre-requisites

### Hardware
As this is a hands-on workshop, we recommend that you bring your own laptop.
We also recommend bringing a mouse, as this will make some tasks,
such as image annotation, much easier. A dedicated graphics card (GPU)
is not required.

### Software
You will need an IDE (a code editor) for Python programming.
We recommend one of the following:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install)

A working conda (or mamba) installation. If you don't have it, install via [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

A working [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installation.

We will contact you at least a week before the event with instructions on
how to install some additional specific software packages.

### Python knowledge
If you new to coding with Python, we encourage attendance of our __Intro to Python__ workshop on Monday, or an equivalent course prior to the event. This will be a hands-on introduction to Python programming, and will cover the basics, including data types, control flow, functions, and libraries. This is a great opportunity to get up to speed with Python before the main event.

### Data
Bringing your own data is encouraged, but not strictly required. The data could be in the form of
video recordings of animal behaviour, and/or motion tracks you've already generated from videos.
This is a great opportunity to get help with your data and to learn from others.
We expect that participant-led ideas that gain traction from any of the sub-events above can be taken forward as ideas for the __Hackathon__ on Friday.

If you have no suitable data, we will provide some example datasets for you to work with.
