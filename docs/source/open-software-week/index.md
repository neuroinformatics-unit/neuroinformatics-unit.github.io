# Open Software Week

We are excited to announce our inaugural **NIU Open Software Week**, taking
place in **August 2025** in **London, UK**. This event will bring together researchers, developers, and users of open-source software for some hands-on training, community-building and hacking.

:::{admonition} Applications are open. Apply for your spot now by filling in [this Google form](https://forms.gle/2UAAzikhSgYArZpX7)!

To maximise our impact, we aim to select participants that would benefit the most from the event, and that can bring the experience back to a diverse set of fields. Please be specific in your application and tailor it to the main track(s) that you are planning to attend. Attendance is free of charge (coffee and lunch are provided) and we expect to be able to offer 10-15 travel stipends of between £300 and £1500 for those that make a strong case for attendance and lack alternative funding sources.

## Schedule

Sessions will run daily between **10:00** and **17:00**.
Here is an overview of the whole week:

There are three **main tracks** targeted to different audiences.
We encourage you to read each track's description and choose the one that best fits your interests.
You can apply for at most 2 of 3 main tracks, and note that [Animals in Motion](track-animals-in-motion) and [BrainGlobe](track-brainglobe)
cannot be combined as they are running in parallel.

## Funding

The [Animals in Motion](track-animals-in-motion) and the [Big Imaging Data](track-big-imaging-data) tracks have been made possible by [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) fellowships to **Niko Sirmpilatze** and **Alessandro Felder**, respectively. The NIU Open Software Week is further supported by the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/). We thank the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/) and the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit) for providing facilities for the event.
