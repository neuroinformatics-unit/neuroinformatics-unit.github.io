Here is an overview of the whole week:

<img src="../_static/osw_images/schedule-2025_light-mode.png" alt="A colour-coded table showing the schedule of open software week. The columns are weekdays, and the rows are Morning and Afternoon. All of Monday and Friday will be spent on 'Intro to Python' and 'Hackday', respectively. Tuesday and Wednesday are split into two whole-day main tracks: 'Animals in Motion' and 'BrainGlobe'. On Thursday, one can choose between either a full day of 'Big Imaging Data' or 'Careers Clinic' in the morning and 'Collaborative Coding with git' in the afternoon." class="only-light img-responsive"/>

There are three **main tracks** targeted to different audiences.
We encourage you to read each track's description and choose the one that best fits your interests.
You can apply for at most 2 of 3 main tracks, and note that [Animals in Motion](track-animals-in-motion) and [BrainGlobe](track-brainglobe)
cannot be combined as they are running in parallel.

:::{dropdown} Intro to Python
:name: intro-to-python
:color: primary
:icon: code-square

Python is one of the most popular programming languages worldwide and is used in all areas of science. As one of the 
most flexible languages it can be used to automate routine tasks, visualise data, process images and run statistical 
tests, along with many other applications.

The morning session will introduce you to the basics of programming in Python and get you up and running 
on your own machine. No experience is necessary, all you need is a laptop you can install software on.

The afternoon session will provide some further Python training, and particularly introduce good practices that 
will pay dividends as you dive deeper into programming. 

## Contents

**Morning**

*   Introduction to Python
*   Variables
*   Data types
*   Loops
*   Conditional statements
*   List comprehension
*   Loading and saving data
*   Writing your first Python script

**Afternoon**

*   Using third party libraries from pip and conda
*   Functions
*   Classes and objects
*   Errors and exceptions
*   Organising your Python project and importing functions
*   Documenting your code

:::{dropdown} Careers Clinic
:name: careers-clinic
:color: primary
:icon: briefcase

The Careers Clinic will consist of a panel discussion from diverse Research Technology Professionals with a background in life sciences.
We hope for the discussion to benefit those interested in exploring non-traditional career paths in research.
The audience is encouraged to prepare questions for the panellists, and reflect on their own careers.

Panelists include:

- **Mayo Faulkner**, Senior User Experience Engineer at the International Brain Lab
- **Vicki Yorke-Edwards**, Senior Research Data Steward at UCL Advanced Research Computing Centre
- **Batool Almarzouq**, Manager of Imago (Imagery Smart Data Service), part of the Smart Data Research UK programme
- **Laura Porta**, Senior Research Software Engineer in the Neuroinformatics Unit
- **Jonas Hartmann**, Postdoctoral Researcher at UCL Cell + Developmental Biology

If you've signed up for the Careers Clinic, please arrive at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre
by **11:30** on **Thursday**. This will give you a chance to grab a coffee from the Ground Floor Lecture Theatre before being guided to the 3rd Floor Seminar Room for
the panel discussion, which will start at **11:45**.

:::{dropdown} Collaborative coding with git
:name: collaborative-coding-with-git
:color: primary
:icon: git-pull-request

Learn how to version control your code and collaborate with others using `git` and GitHub. This workshop is open to all but is especially recommended for those who are planning to participate in the following day's hackathon.

We will cover:
- An introduction to `git` and GitHub
- How to set up `git` on your computer
- Using `git` to save, track and manage your code
- Sharing code and working collaboratively with `git` / GitHub

(target-hackday)=
:::{dropdown} Hackday
:name: hackday
:color: primary
:icon: people
On **Friday, 15 August** we will run a collaborative hackday. This will involve self-organising into small groups and tackling a project of interest hands-on and together, in a fun atmosphere.

If you've signed up for the Hackday, we encourage you to start thinking about potential project ideas.
You can propose an idea by visiting this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/osw25-hackday) and clicking **"New Issue" > "Hackday project idea"**.

You can browse existing proposals on this [board](https://github.com/orgs/neuroinformatics-unit/projects/19/views/1).
If something catches your eye, feel free to leave a comment under the relevant issue to express your interest or ask questions.
We hope that this will get the ball rolling on team formation, which will be finalised on Friday morning.
Don't worry if you don't have a concrete idea just yet â€” we expect plenty of Hackday ideas to emerge organically throughout Open Software Week.

**Projects don't need to involve coding.** As long as it's something that would benefit from collaboration with other Open Software Week participants, it's fair game!
Here are a few examples of the kinds of projects that could be a great fit:

- **Apply a tool**: Use any software you learned about during the week to analyse an interesting dataset (your own or a public one).
- **Give feedback**: Raise issues on relevant open-source tools. Suggest missing features, report bugs, or flag unclear documentation.
- **Make a contribution**: Submit a pull request to an open-source repository. If it's your first time, don't worry; there'll be plenty of people around to support you.
- **Collaborative writing**: Draft something together, like a blog post, white paper, or improved documentation.
- **Prototype an idea**: Try out a cool new analysis or method on real-world data and share your findings.

We're looking forward to seeing what you come up with! You will get the chance to present your progress at the end of the Hackday.

## Prerequisites

As this is a hands-on event, you will need to bring your own **laptop** and **charger**. Any fairly recent laptop will be suitable, you don't need a dedicated GPU.

:::{note}
If you already have a working Anaconda or Miniconda installation and have used it to run Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks, you can likely skip ahead to the [additional track-specific prerequisites](target-track-specific-prerequisites).
:::

To prepare your computer for Python development, we recommend following the [Software Carpentries installation instructions](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions), in particular:

- [Bash Shell](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#shell), to run terminal commands
- [Git](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#git), including a GitHub account
- [Python](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#python), via the [conda-forge installer](https://conda-forge.org/download/). Please make sure you install a __Python version >= 3.12__ (e.g. 3.12 is fine, 3.10 is not).

You'll also need a code editor (IDE) configured for Python.
If you already have one you're comfortable with, feel free to use it. Otherwise, we recommend:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

(target-track-specific-prerequisites)=
:::{admonition} Additional track-specific prerequisites
:class: warning

Apart from the general development tools mentioned above, each track may have additional prerequisites. The following links will take you there:
- [Animals in Motion](target-animals-in-motion-prerequisites)
- [BrainGlobe](target-brainglobe-prerequisites)
- [Big Imaging Data](target-imaging-prerequisites)

Please arrive 30 minutes early if you are facing problems installing course prerequisites.
