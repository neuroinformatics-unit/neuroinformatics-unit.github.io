We are excited to announce our participation in the Google Summer of Code program for 2025!

## What is Google Summer of Code?
[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC) is a **global online programme** for introducing new developers to open source software. Participants get hands-on experience in real world development, become part of an open source community and also receive a stipend from Google.

In 2025, NIU has been accepted as a mentoring organisation. This means weâ€™ll be guiding selected contributors through 12-week programming projects, pairing them with NIU developers to work on our software tools. So if youâ€™re keen to contribute to open source tools that support neuroscience research, this is your chance!


## How can you participate?
Please check our [GSoC site](../get-involved/gsoc/index.md) for more details on the program and how to apply to work with us. In short, the process involves:

1. **Checking our [project ideas list](../get-involved/gsoc/projects_2025/index.md)**, to see what projects we have on offer. Our projects for GSoC 2025 are organised under [four of our software tools](../get-involved/gsoc/index.md#gsoc-niu-projects-2025). This is not a definitive list, so if you have a project idea that fits within our scope, feel free to propose it.

2. **Get in touch** with us to discuss your project idea. Potential GSoC contributors are encouraged to get in touch with participating organisations to clarify and better outline the work involved in a project. This will likely strengthen your application - remember that discussing things in the open is a big part of open source. We use [Zulip](https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/) as our main channel of communication. You can start a new topic in our [GSoC channel](https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/487898-GSoC) to ask questions to the community. 

3. **Prepare your application** following our [guidelines](../get-involved/gsoc/guidelines.md). Our guidelines include a series of tips that will help you write a strong proposal to work with us, and an application template with the requirements. Make sure you read these carefully before applying! Remember you will need to link a code contribution to your application, and your project proposal should be discussed with the mentors and the community in our wiki. Check the guidelines for more details!

4. **Submit your application to the GSoC system**. Remember to submit your application before [the 8th April deadline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline#april_8_-_1800_utc)! All applications must go through [Google's application system](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) - please do not send any applications directly to the NIU team.

We also recommend checking the full [eligibility requirements for contributors](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules), the program [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) and further details on the [official GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). 

We would like to make the most of the global, fully-remote aspect of this program and we actively encourage applications from students from underrepresented groups in STEM, and from all over the world! We are committed to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all contributors. Our working languages are English (and Python ðŸ˜‰), but we also speak other languages - you can find the languages spoken by the mentors in each of the projects' descriptions.

## Get in touch!

If you are interested in participating or have any questions about the above, feel free to get in touch with us via [Zulip](https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/).
