# Trusted by design (part 3): embrace radically open communication

_Open-source software is public, yet much of the communication around it happens in private emails, internal Slack channels, and meetings with no minutes. This disconnect can erode the very trust that openness is meant to build. What if communication were radically open—a habit of constant, multi-way interactions visible to anyone who cares to look?_

This is the last of three blogposts on the theme of _Trusted by design: set up your research software for community adoption_. See the [introductory blogpost](target-trusted-by-design-intro) for context.

The trust-building practices we covered in the two previous blogposts—articulating your project's mission and making incremental releases—can be thought of as announcing your project to the world. But communication can be—and should be—more than occasional announcements. Here we'll look at communication at its most granular: the day-to-day conversations that take place in issues, pull requests, discussion forums, and social media.

Our team's approach to communication could be summarised as:
**write everything down, make it public by default, and let the magic happen.**

## Issues as a public scratchpad

We use [GitHub issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues) as a scratchpad. Our recipe for that is simple:

- If you get a new idea, write it down as an issue.
- If you obtain new information about an existing idea, comment under the issue.
- If an idea grows to burst its banks, break it down into smaller, more manageable issues.
- If two ideas are related, cross-link the issues.
- If an idea is no longer relevant, close the issue.

There is not much special about GitHub issues. [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) or various project management systems can be used to the same effect.

Ideas don't have to be fully-fleshed to end up in issues. **If you can formulate it as a sentence, it's ready to be written down.**

Minimising the time between forming a thought and writing it down should be your utmost priority. Do it, even if it feels like talking to yourself. Writing will save you tons of time and effort. I forget, you forget, everyone forgets. At least once a week I thank my past self for having written something down. It feels like reading a message in a bottle from a stranger. And it might as well be, as I typically have no memory of its contents.

A long list of issues guarantees you'll never run out of things to do. Whenever you find yourself with some time to work on the project, issues of all sizes and shapes will be vying for your attention. Writing also clarifies your thinking. Don't think of it as keeping records, but as prying order out of your disordered thoughts. You will often realise that something makes no sense while writing it down. If you are lucky, you may see a path to breathing some sense into it.

Wait, you'll say, I can achieve the same with a private notebook or a diary. Why write publicly, risking looking ignorant or incoherent? It goes against our urge to cultivate an image of expertise and authority. But the open-source ethos not only acknowledges that everyone is fallible, it takes it for granted. Good software emerges from the interactions of many fallible agents, not from the works of a genius. If you are a project's shepherd, your job is to make interactions as seamless as possible. A public, open-to-all, lively, and active issue tracker is one of the most effective ways to achieve that.

Let's drive this point home with a thought experiment. You are using software made by someone else and you stumble on a bug. You go to the project's GitHub page, hoping to find an existing report. Instead you find only a handful of issues, all by the main developer, the last one from a year ago. Will you open an issue to report the bug? Probably not. You lack social context and don't know what to expect. Will the maintainers respond to a stranger? Will they be nice about it? If only there was a track record of issues containing interactions between the developers and the community!

Every unreported bug and unrequested feature is a missed opportunity for improvement—not only for the developers but for every interested party seeking answers in that repository. And that loss is largely invisible. You don't know what insights you're passing up by failing to cultivate a lively and welcoming issue tracker.
You're also missing out on the greatest joy of open-source development: like-minded strangers who volunteer to solve your problems. Strangers will pick up issues more often than you think. Some of them will turn into regular contributors, long-term collaborators, or even friends. People are the engine of open-source, and they are attracted by interesting problems. Give them—and your project—a chance, by writing things down.
