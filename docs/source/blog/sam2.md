## Worms?
When studying animal behaviour, _Caenorhabditis elegans_ is not the first model organism 
most people think of. However, they are used frequently as a model for drug discovery, 
developmental biology, genetics, and other areas. Changes in the behaviour are thereby 
an important readout, indicating the effectiveness of a drug, a developmental defect, or 
the contribution of a specific gene. The main advantage of using _C. elegans_ over mammalian
models like mice is the simpleness. This is also true for the OSW hackday project described 
here: what could be easier to skeletonize than a worm!
