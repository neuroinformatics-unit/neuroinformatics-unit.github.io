# Open Software Week
It's already been almost a month since I returned home to Vienna from a fantastic week in London for the first edition of [Open Software Week](https://neuroinformatics.dev/open-software-week/) hosted by [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (SWC)](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/) and organized by the [Neuroinformatics Unit](https://neuroinformatics.dev/).
