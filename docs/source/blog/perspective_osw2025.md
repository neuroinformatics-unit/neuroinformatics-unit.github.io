# Open Software Week
It's already been almost a month since I returned home to Vienna from a fantastic week in London for the first edition of [Open Software Week](https://neuroinformatics.dev/open-software-week/) hosted by [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/) and organized by the [Neuroinformatics Unit](https://neuroinformatics.dev/).

OSW was a celebration of knowledge and experience exchange merged with neuroscience applications and best practices in Python programming. If you are at all into open-source, education, programming or neuroscience, you don't want to miss the next iteration of the course (which hopefully will become a yearly appointment)!

In this perspective piece, I wanted to go through some personal opinions on a few aspects of the event.

## The Program
OSW consisted of an [impressive program](https://neuroinformatics.dev/open-software-week/#schedule), escalating from an introduction to Python fundamentals all the way to advanced neuroscience Python applications and even a hack-day dedicated to nourish an open-source spirit of contribution and to problem-solving.

While every single session would have deserved attendance, I have to limit my perspective on the sessions I actually followed. I opted for the [BrainGlobe](https://neuroinformatics.dev/open-software-week/brainglobe.html#track-brainglobe) track and the [Big Imaging Data](https://neuroinformatics.dev/open-software-week/big-imaging-data.html#track-big-imaging-data) track. The [Animals in motion](https://animals-in-motion.neuroinformatics.dev/latest/) attracted many participants and I really wish I could have joined both tracks in the first half of the week!

I loved the fact that the BrainGlobe program was all hands-on, with a lot of coding exercises and practical examples. Needless to say, this wouldn't have worked without excellent instructors and teaching assistants all throughout the course. Personally I found it a bit of a pity that most of the material was already present in the excellent [BrainGlobe tutorials](https://brainglobe.info/tutorials/), but that didn't take away from the many chances I got to interact with other participants, each with their own data to wrangle and explore. It was also perfect for many participants who were exposed to the package and its capabilities for the first time.

I also enjoyed the Big Imaging Data track more than I thought I would. I was already familiar with some of the packages presented (like [napari](https://napari.org/), [dask](https://dask.org/) and [zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)), but I learned so much more from the hands-on exercise on Zarr export and from the discussions happening in the room. I absolutely loved the fact that many experts from different fields all working with Zarr and other scientific fields came along for this track and gave their perspective.

While OSW centered around [BrainGlobe](https://brainglobe.info/) and [Movement](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/index.html), two of neuroscience dedicated packages maintained by the [Neuroinformatics Unit](https://neuroinformatics.dev/), the event had a suprisingly vast amount of event variety (one might not expect). Towards the end of the week, sessions on career discussions, fundamentals of version control with Git, and even a speed blogging event were weaved together in extremely attractive program for all types of profiles and experience levels.

Although not part of the official program, I appreciated how the NIU team thought of organizing a few social events in the evenings, which were perfect to unwind and get to know each other better. There was a social activity every evening of the week, from a walk through Hyde Park to a OSW-inspired pub quiz, to even some code-along synthetic music event in a pub! Thank you for that, it was surely something!

Overall, the program was extremely well thought out and organized, with a perfect balance between lectures, hands-on exercises, breaks, and social events. A few details to iron out are always there, but that's to be expected for a first edition of an event.
