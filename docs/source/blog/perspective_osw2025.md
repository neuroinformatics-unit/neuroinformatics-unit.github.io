# Open Software Week
It's already been almost a month since I returned home to Vienna from a fantastic week in London for the first edition of [Open Software Week](https://neuroinformatics.dev/open-software-week/) hosted by [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (SWC)](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/) and organized by the [Neuroinformatics Unit](https://neuroinformatics.dev/).

OSW was a celebration of knowledge and experience exchange merged with neuroscience applications and best practices in Python programming. If you are at all into open-source, education, programming or neuroscience, you don't want to miss the next iteration of the course (which hopefully will become a yearly appointment)!

In this perspective piece, I wanted to go through some personal opinions on a few aspects of the event.

## The Program
OSW consisted of an impressive program, escalating from an introduction to Python fundamentals all the way to advanced neuroscience Python applications and even a hack-day dedicated to nourish an open-source spirit of contribution and to problem-solving.

While every single session would have deserved attendance, I have to limit my perspective on the sessions I actually followed. I opted for the [BrainGlobe](link here) track and the [Large Data](link here) track. The [Animals in motion](link here) attracted many participants and I really wish I could have joined both tracks in the first half of the week!

While OSW centered around [BrainGlobe] and [Movement], the two neuroscience dedicated packages maintained by the [Neuroinformatics Unit](https://neuroinformatics.dev/), the event had a suprisingly vast amount of event variety (one might not expect). Towards the end of the week, sessions on career discussions, fundamentals of version control with Git, and even a speed blogging event were weaved together in extremely attractive program for all types of profiles and experience levels.
