# Collaborations

We collaborate with external labs in a number of ways.

If you have a feature request or bug report, please open an issue on the relevant GitHub repository.
If you are unsure where to open an issue, please get in touch via [Zulip](https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/) or email (adam.tyson@ucl.ac.uk).

## Collaboration models

We want to help as many people as possible, but we have limited resources.
We have outlined some of the ways we work with external labs below.

### 1. Feature requests

If you need a feature, and it's near the top of our priorities, you could wait for us to build it, or help us out by contributing code!

### 2. Lower priority features

If you need a feature, and it's on our priority list, but not at the top, you could:
* Raise a PR yourself
* Discuss with us and [ARC](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/advanced-research-computing-centre) about working with ARC developers to prioritise the feature.

### 3. Large features / new projects

If the feature is large, or you have a new project in mind, please discuss with us about applying for some dedicated funding.
We have a lot of experience in writing grant applications, and we are happy to help you write the technical parts of your proposal.
