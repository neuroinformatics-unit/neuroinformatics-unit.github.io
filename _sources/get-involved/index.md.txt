# Get involved
We always welcome contributions to all of our software, whether from experienced developers, or researchers looking 
to make their first open-source contribution. 

Many of our projects are quite large and the software is used by researchers around the world. For this reason, all 
contributions go through a review process to make sure that they are necessary, useful, correct and complete. This 
"code review" process can often be daunting to first time contributors. It is often not difficult to meet these criteria,
but it can be _complicated_. 

For this reason we have written some documents to outline the processes we use, so hopefully they aren't so opaque. 
We are also happy to guide new contributors through the process. For more details please see 
[details about mentored open source contributions](mentoring).
